NORMAL TASK- Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
# Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing global terrorism data. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist incidents using a comprehensive dataset.

## Dataset

Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/razamh/exploratory-data-analysis-terrorism/input

## Analysis Highlights

The EDA covers various aspects of the terrorism dataset, including:

- Temporal trends: Analyzing the frequency of terrorist incidents over time.
- Geographical distribution: Visualizing the hotspots of terrorist activities on a world map.
- Attack types: Exploring the most common methods of attack used by terrorists.
- Targets: Analyzing the types of targets chosen by terrorists.
- Group affiliations: Identifying prominent terrorist groups and their activities.
- Casualties: Investigating the impact of terrorist incidents on human lives.

## Results and Visualizations

A comprehensive set of visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, boxplot,pie chart , provide insights into various aspects of global terrorism. Key findings and observations are discussed within the notebooks.

RESULTS:

* Terrorist attack was maximum in year 2014
* The most common and highest no of attacks were Bombing/Explosion
* From the boxplot we can coclude that most casualities or deaths were happened in case of Hostage Taking(Kidnapping)
* We can find slightly negative correlation for number of kills vs no of wounded as we can see if one paramter killing increases the wounded decreases
* From Line plot we can infer that as year 2000 there is steady increase in terrorist incident
* from violin plot , we can infer that the terrorist killing group mostly belong to MILITARY and Private citizens
* From bar plot we conclude that the terrorist attack was more in country BURUNDI followed by INDIA
* from bar chart , we can infer that the terrorist killing group mostly belong to Private citizens
* trend in terrorism raises after year 2000
* No of kills is more in region belonging to Middle east and North africa follow by north america

## Conclusion

This EDA project aims to shed light on the patterns and characteristics of global terrorism using exploratory data analysis. By visualizing and summarizing the data, we aim to better understand the dynamics of terrorist incidents and contribute to informed discussions and decisions regarding counterterrorism efforts.
